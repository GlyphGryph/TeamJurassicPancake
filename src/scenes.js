Also not the first day of my long term intermittent depression. Today's an okay day though, I feel like I can get out of bed, so let's go with that. Been saving up for this time, I have enough money to go without work for a while.</p> <p>Apartment's a bit messy, but that's how it's been for months. I'm not that big on clinical neatness, but you can find stuff, and there are no alien lifeforms spawning in here, so that's good enough for now.</p> <p>Do the morning routines, get some breakfast, all that usual jazz. Cornflakes again. Not the most exciting, but affordable enough.</p> <p>So, how do I even proceed with this?</p>",

So what they're telling me is that I just have to keep painting and avoid seeming desperate. Easy for them to say, they're already there. They say that getting criticism will help you improve quickly, but am I ready for that?</p>",
